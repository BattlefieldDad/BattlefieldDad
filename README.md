If you use any of the code in this repository, please credit 'Battlefield Dad' and my channel in any
experiences, videos or submissions you make. It's all I ask! Thanks.

This is the code repository for my Youtube channel 'Battlefield Dad'
You can find video tutorials, guides and the latest news for 
Battlefield 2042 Portal on my channel at

I recommend you install the Battlefield Portal 2042 Extension for your web browser:
https://github.com/LennardF1989/BF2042-Portal-Extensions

This will allow you to import these files directly into the Portal Rules Editor.

I will have a video on this coming soon!

This will allow you to back up your experience code and work around the experience limit.
